# deeplearning-study
homeworks of Andrew Ng's deeplearning courses ( i-j : lessen i week j programing practice )

when i study this course, i first try to solve the problem by myself, and program in my style. 
then when i trapped, i will look for other people's solution.
i think this way of study is really helpful, and i hope you can program better.
